# Leveling Framework

At DexaMinds, we recognize that growth isn’t linear — it’s multidimensional. Our engineering leveling framework provides a clear, flexible path for personal development, technical mastery, and leadership. This framework is not just about promotions; it's a tool for self-reflection, career conversations, and intentional growth.

## 🎯 Purpose

- Define expectations at each level of engineering contribution.
- Foster transparency, consistency, and fairness in evaluations.
- Encourage ownership of one’s growth journey through structured guidance.

## 🧭 Career Tracks

We offer two equally respected tracks:

- **Individual Contributor (IC)** — Deep technical expertise, ownership of systems, thought leadership.
- **Engineering Manager (EM)** — People leadership, team orchestration, delivery accountability.

Transitions between tracks are supported and celebrated.
