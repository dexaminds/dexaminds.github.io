# Mentorship

Mentorship is a cornerstone of the DexaMinds engineering culture. We believe that greatness is not achieved in isolation â€” it is cultivated through shared wisdom, trusted guidance, and meaningful human connections.

Our mentorship program is designed to empower every engineer to thrive â€” whether youâ€™re just starting out or preparing to lead large systems or teams.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Accelerate growth through guidance, not gatekeeping.
- Build trusted relationships that foster psychological safety.
- Promote a culture of giving back and lifting others as we rise.
- Support both technical and non-technical aspects of career growth.

## ðŸ‘¥ Mentorship Models

We support different types of mentorship based on context and goals:

### 1. **Onboarding Mentorship**
- Assigned to every new engineer.
- Helps navigate tools, systems, and culture during the first 90 days.

### 2. **Technical Mentorship**
- Deep dive into specific domains (e.g., DevOps, Frontend, ML).
- Often led by senior engineers or domain experts.

### 3. **Career Mentorship**
- Focused on long-term growth, goal setting, and leveling up.
- Conversations often include feedback, confidence building, and leadership.

### 4. **Peer Mentorship**
- Informal, lateral support from colleagues.
- Encourages vulnerability, problem-solving, and shared learning.

## âœ¨ Culture of Mentorship

At DexaMinds, mentorship is not a title or a program â€” it's a mindset. We believe:

- Everyone has something to teach, and everyone has something to learn.
- Mentorship should be reciprocal, empowering, and joyful.
- The impact of a good mentor extends far beyond technical skill â€” it shapes careers, confidence, and culture.
