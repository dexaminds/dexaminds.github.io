# Code of Conduct

At DexaMinds, we believe that great products emerge not only from brilliant ideas and skillful engineering but from a culture rooted in integrity, respect, and collaboration.

Let this Code serve as both a compass and a commitment — to lead with purpose, create with passion, and build with people at the center.
