We believe that greatness is not achieved in isolation \u2014 it is cultivated through shared wisdom, trusted guidance, and meaningful human connections. Our mentorship program is designed to empower every engineer to thrive \u2014 whether you\u2019re just starting out or preparing to lead large systems or teams. \ud83c\udfaf Objectives Accelerate growth through guidance, not gatekeeping. Build trusted relationships that foster psychological safety. Promote a culture of giving back and lifting others as we rise. Support both technical and non-technical aspects of career growth. \ud83d\udc65 Mentorship Models We support different types of mentorship based on context and goals: 1. Onboarding Mentorship Assigned to every new engineer. Helps navigate tools, systems, and culture during the first 90 days. 2. Technical Mentorship Deep dive into specific domains (e.g., DevOps, Frontend, ML). Often led by senior engineers or domain experts. 3. Career Mentorship Focused on long-term growth, goal setting, and leveling up. Conversations often include feedback, confidence building, and leadership. 4. Peer Mentorship Informal, lateral support from colleagues. Encourages vulnerability, problem-solving, and shared learning. \ud83d\udd04 How It Works Kickoff: New engineers are paired with a mentor within the first week. Cadence: Regular check-ins (weekly or bi-weekly) encouraged. Tooling: Notion templates and prompts to guide conversations. Tracking: Outcomes and growth plans are logged collaboratively. \ud83d\udca1 Tips for Mentees Be proactive \u2014 mentorship is a two-way street. Ask questions, share goals, and own your journey. Respect your mentor\u2019s time and come prepared. \ud83c\udf31 Tips for Mentors Listen more than you speak. Share both successes and failures. Adapt your style to the mentee\u2019s needs. Celebrate growth \u2014 big or small. \u2728 Culture of Mentorship At DexaMinds, mentorship is not a title or a program \u2014 it's a mindset. We believe: Everyone has something to teach, and everyone has something to learn. Mentorship should be reciprocal, empowering, and joyful. The impact of a good mentor extends far beyond technical skill \u2014 it shapes careers, confidence, and culture. \"True leadership is planting seeds in a garden you may never see bloom.\" Let's continue planting boldly.","title":"Mentorship"},{"location":"career-growth/mentorship/#mentorship","text":"Mentorship is a cornerstone of the DexaMinds engineering culture.

Initial Setup \u2705 Install Git Download from: https://git-scm.com/downloads \u2705 Configure Git git config --global user.name \"Your Name\" git config --global user.email \"your.email@dexaminds.com\" git config --global core.editor \"code --wait\" # Optional: Set VS Code as default editor \u2705 Verify Configuration git config --list \ud83d\udcc1 2. Repository Management \u2705 Clone a Repository git clone https://github.com/your-org/repo-name.git \u2705 Create a New Repository (Local) mkdir my-project cd my-project git init \u2705 Link to Remote Repository git remote add origin https://github.com/your-org/repo-name.git git push -u origin main \u274c Delete a Local Repository rm -rf my-project \ud83c\udf3f 3. Branching Operations \u2705 Create a New Branch git checkout -b feature/branch-name \ud83d\udd01 Switch Between Branches git checkout main \ud83d\udd00 Merge a Branch git checkout main git merge feature/branch-name \u274c Delete a Branch git branch -d feature/branch-name # Safe delete git branch -D feature/branch-name # Force delete \ud83d\udd01 4. Commit Workflow This section outlines the standard Git commit workflow that every developer at DexaMinds should follow: \ud83e\udded Step-by-Step Commit Workflow Pull latest changes from the remote branch: bash git pull origin branch-name Check status of your working directory: bash git status Stage the changes you want to commit: bash git add file-name # Add specific file git add . # Add all changes Review staged changes (optional but recommended): bash git diff --cached Commit with a meaningful message : bash git commit -m \"feat: add login validation for user form\" Push your changes to the remote branch: bash git push origin branch-name Create a Pull Request on GitHub and request review. \ud83d\udd0d 5. Working with Pull Requests (PRs) \u2705 Create a PR Push your branch to GitHub. Go to GitHub \u2192 Open your repo \u2192 Click \"Compare & pull request\" . Add title, description, reviewers, and submit. \u2705 Review a PR Use GitHub UI to comment, approve, or request changes. \u2705 Merge a PR After approval, click \"Merge pull request\" on GitHub. \ud83e\uddea 6.

It\u2019s how we connect across boundaries, resolve complexity, and align toward impactful outcomes. In our hybrid and distributed environment, great communication is not accidental \u2014 it is intentional, inclusive, and infused with clarity and care. Whether we are brainstorming on a whiteboard, collaborating asynchronously across time zones, or writing documentation, we communicate to build trust, reduce friction, and enable velocity. \ud83c\udfaf Principles Our communication is shaped by the following guiding principles: \ud83d\udca1 Clarity Over Complexity Communicate simply and purposefully. Eliminate ambiguity. Choose words that inform, not confuse. \ud83c\udf0d Transparency is Default Share context openly unless confidentiality requires otherwise. Document decisions and learnings for collective benefit. \ud83e\udde0 Empathy in Every Exchange Seek to understand before responding. Respect different styles, cultures, and bandwidths. \ud83d\udd53 Asynchronous First Protect deep work time by reducing meetings where possible. Use async updates, threads, and comments to keep progress visible. \ud83d\udd01 Feedback is Fuel Share constructive feedback regularly and respectfully. Create safe spaces for dialogue, disagreement, and growth. \ud83d\udee0 Tools We Use DexaMinds leverages a combination of synchronous and asynchronous tools \u2014 including Microsoft and modern collaboration platforms \u2014 to enable effective, flexible communication across teams and geographies. Tool Purpose Microsoft Teams Real-time chat, group discussions, voice/video meetings, and team channels. Used for cross-functional collaboration and daily syncs. Microsoft 365 (Outlook, Word, Excel, OneNote, etc.) Formal emails, shared documents, collaborative planning sheets, and meeting notes. GitHub Code-centric discussions, pull request comments, issues, and changelogs. \u26a1 Note: Use the right tool for the right message. Don\u2019t escalate to meetings when a well-written message will do. Don\u2019t bury critical decisions in chat threads \u2014 document them clearly. \ud83d\udccb Best Practices For Written Communication Use clear subject lines , structure with headers and bullets. Set expectations : include action items, deadlines, and ownership. Be inclusive: avoid inside jokes or region-specific slang. Use emojis for tone, but sparingly in formal communications. For Meetings (Teams, GitHub, Office 365) Share an agenda in the invite or shared OneNote/Notion. Designate a facilitator and a note-taker. Capture and circulate key takeaways and next steps. Keep meetings purposeful \u2014 start and end on time. For Emails (Outlook) Start with a brief summary or objective. Use formatting (bold, italics, bullets) to improve scan-ability. Cc relevant stakeholders, but avoid overloading threads. Keep follow-up loops tight and actionable. \ud83c\udf10 Global & Remote Communication In a distributed environment, respect time zones and team schedules: Use Microsoft Teams\u2019 status indicators (e.g., \u201cDo Not Disturb\u201d) mindfully. Favor async updates (e.g., Teams channels, email summaries). Don\u2019t expect immediate replies unless marked urgent and agreed upon. We encourage using \"core collaboration hours\" for meetings and shared work, and respecting focus blocks to protect deep thinking. \ud83d\udcac Communication Culture at DexaMinds At DexaMinds, communication is not just about transmitting information \u2014 it's about building relationships, aligning purpose, and creating momentum.
